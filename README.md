# Better Error plugin

A PluginLoader plugin that assists in development of mods by providing "rich tracebacks."

# TODOs

- [ ] Configurable action for clicking filenames (right now it's hardcoded to VSCode)
- [ ] Button to show the SCREEN_CANVAS plainly (like Speed Duel's)
- [ ] Option to load a save or continue gameplay after error (Requires Kristal patch unless we want to abuse debug lib)
